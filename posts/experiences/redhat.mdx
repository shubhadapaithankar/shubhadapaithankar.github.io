- I migrated the old infrastructure from single server Docker deployment to **Kubernetes** on **Google Cloud**.
- I had to migrate stored objects and databases data and automate the deployment with a **CI/CD**.
- This led to a better scalability of the infrastructure and more safety for the storage of the data.
- Experienced in Build/Release and Delivery Management, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and cloud migration services using CloudFormation and Terraform.
- Managed and maintained OpenShift Container Platforms, including installation, configuration, patching, security, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
- Built scalable infrastructure using AWS services, including network connectivity troubleshooting and hybrid environments.
