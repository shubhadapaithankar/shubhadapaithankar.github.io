caption: In the Covid-19 pandemic, almost every country in the world conducted campaigns worldwide to vaccinate people. As a result, many countries have been asking for proof of vaccination for travel. However, there is no single reliable source of health records available. Thus, It isn't easy to build a vaccine passport accepted everywhere. We intend to solve this problem by leveraging the blockchain's distributed ledger technology (DLT).
